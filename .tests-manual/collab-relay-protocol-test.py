"""
Protocol test for TiXLCollabRelay. Start a relay, then run this against it:

    dotnet run --project CollabRelay -- 45990
    python .tests-manual/collab-relay-protocol-test.py 45990

Covers the short replies old editors expect, the session list, identity fields, room keys
(a silent host can be replaced, a live one cannot, the same host instance reclaims its room),
and members being closed when their host leaves. Takes about 30 s: one case waits for a host
to count as silent. Discord verification needs a real token and is only covered by the
"bad token stays unverified" case.
